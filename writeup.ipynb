    "If the PS in (2) do not commute with each other one can proceed as follows. First, one needs to divide the set of the Pauli strings into several subsets with all the terms inside the subset commuting with each other. The next step is to apply one of the Suzuki-Trotter approximating formulas [5]. As a result, one will obtain the product of the operations of form (2) with commuting PS."
